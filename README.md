# ft_printf

Mimics most of printf's behavior.

Code is not very efficient and does not follow clean code practices, as I was attempting to maximize 
conciseness while following some stringent formatting restrictions in the original assignment:
(max of 25 lines per function, 4 parameters per function, 5 variables per function, etc.)

Enjoy!
