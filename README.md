# ft_printf

Mimics most of printf's behavior.

I was trying to write concise code under some pretty stringent formatting restrictions.
My goal to write the code using the fewest number of lines (ignoring my use of libft)
compromises efficiency as well as a little bit on organization for floating point handling.

Enjoy!
